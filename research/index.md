## PhD research

I was a research assistant in the [Software Performance Optimisation
Group](https://spo.doc.ic.ac.uk/) in the [Department of
Computing](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College
London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk). My supervisors were [Dr. David A.
Ham](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham) and [Prof.  Paul H.J.
Kelly](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/) and I was funded by [EPSRC Grant
EP/L000407/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/L000407/1).
My PhD research was funded by [EPSRC Grant
EP/I00677X/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/I00677X/1).

My research was mostly concerned with delivering high-level tools in the hands
of scientists, allowing them to work very productively and run simulations
efficiently on a range of modern multi- and many-core platforms.

I was a lead developer of [PyOP2](https://github.com/OP2/PyOP2), a framework
for performance-portable parallel computations on unstructured meshes, and
[Firedrake](http://firedrakeproject.org/), an automated system for the
portable solution of partial differential equations using the finite element
method (FEM), built on top of PyOP2. Both of these projects are open source.

### Research objective

Delivering generic and efficient computational solvers for
partial-differential equations through automated code synthesis from a
high-level problem description down to a highly optimised parallel
implementation specifically tailored to the target hardware.

### Research interests

* Domain-specific languages and compilers for partial differential equations
* Finite Element assembly on multi- and many-core architectures
* Automated runtime code generation from high-level specifications
