> {{ site.description | markdownify }}

I am a software engineer with a specialisation in large system design,
distributed systems, reliability and performance. I have several years of
experience designing and developing scientific software with a focus on solving
differential equations and finite-element methods scaling from workstations to
high-performance computing (HPC) environments. I have also designed embedded
domain-specific languages (eDSLs) in Python to describe scientific problems at
a high level and with high expressivity. Furthermore I have some hobbyist
experience in full stack web application development.

Currently I work as a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://sre.google) for
Google in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. My work has a particular focus on Service Level
Objectives (SLOs), reliability and performance for user facing services in
Google Cloud.

Previously I worked as a computational scientist at [ECMWF](https://ecmwf.int),
designing and developing scientific HPC software for processing large amounts
of metereological forecast data.

Previously I was a PhD researcher in the [Software Performance Optimisation
Group](https://spo.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College
London](https://imperial.ac.uk), delivering generic and efficient computational
solvers for partial-differential equations through automated code synthesis
from a high-level problem description down to a highly optimised parallel
implementation specifically tailored to the target hardware. Read more about
this on my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) page or look at my
[publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications).
