> {{ site.description }}

I have several years of experience designing and developing scientific
software with a focus on solving differential equations and finite-element
methods scaling from workstations to high-performance computing (HPC)
environments. I have also designed embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs)
in Python to describe scientific problems at a high level and with high
expressivity. Furthermore I have some (not professional) experience in full stack
web application development.

Currently I work as a computational scientist at [ECMWF](http://ecmwf.int),
designing and developing scientific HPC software for processing large amounts
of metereological forecast data.

Previously I was a PhD research at [Imperial College
London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk), delivering generic and efficient
computational solvers for partial-differential equations through automated
code synthesis from a high-level problem description down to a highly
optimised parallel implementation specifically tailored to the target
hardware.
